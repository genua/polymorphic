Polymorphic
===========

Polymorphic is alternative implementation for polymorphic associations in Rails.
Instead of using one join table which includes all associations, there are
one join table for each associations.

Polymorphic works for has_many and has_one associations.

To use polymorphic edit config/application.rb:
  config.plugins = [ :polymorphic ]
And included to desired file:
  requrie 'polymorphic'


Example
=======

In the example we have three classes:
  class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :streets, :join_table => "street_cars"
  end

  class Bike < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :streets, :join_table => "street_bikes"
  end

  class Street < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_and_belongs_to_many :cars, :join_table => "street_cars"
    has_and_belongs_to_many :bikes, :join_table => "street_bikes"
    polymorphic :vehicles, :cars, :bikes
  end

The has_many associations for cars and bikes in Street need join tables. They
are normal has_many associations as known to rails.

  polymorphic :vehicles, :cars, :bikes
will add a PolyProxy just which behaves like an AssociationProxy wich provied
an interface to the connected has_many associations:
  s = Street.find(1)
  c = Car.first
  s.vehicles << c
